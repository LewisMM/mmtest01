API Description
===============

If this product implements an API, this section will describe the syntax of the API.  Since the source code that implements this functionality should have imbedded docstrings, it may be advisable to set up an automatic linkage to those docstrings to minimize redundant information.  If the automatic linkage is done, the docstring text should be ReST compliant and proofread for style and accuracy.  If this product does implement an API, then it is OK to just type N/A in this section.
